# idata-appointment-checker
Frustrated with iDATA's terrible interface and their failure to open new appointments, I took matters into my own hands and created a web scraping tool for automated appointment tracking.

Feel free to use this in any way you prefer, but keep in mind the responsibility is on you. Just make sure to update the email informations and dates.

to idata devs: maybe consider adding CAPTCHA in the future :)
